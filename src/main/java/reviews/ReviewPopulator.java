Itâ€™s use of several cereals, coconut, and chocolate provide a crunchy, soft, chewy experience you normally only get one of in a cookie. The creator, Marial Miesle, is notorious for having these in the house at all times. It is rumored that she went a whole week eating only these and Diet Coke. While that may be an exaggeration, some members of her family are known to have exclusively eaten only these cookies for an entire day. Over the years the quality of ingredients has risen, as have the variations within the family. Unfortunately, for readers of this review, the recipe is a closely guarded secret only obtainable through marriage.",
